## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Get Master Key
```bash
# Copy this value - you'll need it
cat config/master.key
```

### 3. Deploy to Render
- [ ] Create Render account at [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Create new Blueprint from `render.yaml`
- [ ] Add environment variable: `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`
- [ ] Click "Apply" to deploy
- [ ] Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-29T..."}
```

---

## Post-Deployment

### Verify Functionality
- [ ] Health check responds
- [ ] Sign up works
- [ ] Sign in returns JWT token
- [ ] Books endpoint returns data
- [ ] Dashboard endpoint works
- [ ] Borrowing flow works
- [ ] Authorization enforced

### Test with Demo Credentials
```bash
# Sign in as librarian
curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"admin@library.com","password":"password"}}' \
  -i

# Copy JWT token from Authorization header

# Test librarian dashboard
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Configure Frontend
- [ ] Update frontend API URL to production
- [ ] Test frontend ‚Üí backend connection
- [ ] Verify CORS works
- [ ] Test all user flows

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor database connections
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Configure error tracking (optional)

---

## Environment Variables

### Required
```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<from config/master.key>
RAILS_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<automatically set by Render>
```

### Optional
```
RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=enabled
RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=enabled
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.com
```

---

## CORS Configuration

### Update for Production

Edit `config/initializers/cors.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    # Update this with your frontend domain
    origins ENV.fetch("CORS_ORIGINS", "http://localhost:3001").split(",")
    
    resource "*",
      headers: :any,
      methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head],
      credentials: true
  end
end
```

Then set in Render:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.com,https://www.your-frontend.com
```

---

## Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
Every push to `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions runs CI tests
2. If tests pass, Render auto-deploys
3. Migrations run automatically
4. App restarts with new code

### Manual Deployment
From Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select "Deploy latest commit"

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check database connection
4. Review recent commits

### Rollback to Previous Version
From Render dashboard:
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Find last working deployment
3. Click "Rollback to this version"

---

## Maintenance

### Database Backups
Render automatically backs up PostgreSQL (free tier: daily)

### Manual Backup
```bash
# From Render dashboard
# Database ‚Üí Backups ‚Üí Create Backup
```

### Run Migrations
```bash
render run rails db:migrate -s thelibrarian-api
```

### Access Console
```bash
render run rails console -s thelibrarian-api
```

### View Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
render logs -s thelibrarian-api --tail

# Or in dashboard: Service ‚Üí Logs
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Free Tier Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sleeps after 15min inactivity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 512 MB RAM
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shared CPU

### Prevent Sleep (Options)
1. **Upgrade to paid plan** ($7/month)
2. **Use ping service** (e.g., UptimeRobot)
3. **Switch to Railway/Fly** (no sleep on free tier)

### Monitor Performance
- Response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage
- Error rates

---

## Security Checklist

- [x] HTTPS enabled (automatic on Render)
- [x] JWT tokens with expiration
- [x] Password hashing (bcrypt)
- [x] SQL injection prevention (ActiveRecord)
- [x] Authorization on all endpoints
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting (optional but recommended)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è API versioning (already v1)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Request logging
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Error tracking (Sentry/Rollbar)
